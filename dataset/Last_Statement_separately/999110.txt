What is occurring  here tonight is not justice, it’s murder of an innocent man for a murder that  occurred in 1992. For the last 30 years I’ve proven my innocence to the courts,  but the courts blocked me and then refused me access to the ballistics for 20  years; I’ve proven facts and ballistics to be false. It’s been 30 years now,  the state refused to turn over evidence. Nine of the ten trial motions were  filled for discovery of evidence, but each were denied each time. I asked for  DNA, I was denied DNA. My co-defendant was executed in 2006 and if I’m innocent  he was innocent and they killed an innocent man, and the state doesn’t want the  truth to come out. They won’t allow me DNA. The victim’s son identified on  audio tape it wasn’t me or the co-defendant. The state hid the evidence so long  and good that my own attorneys couldn’t find it. Tonight, Texas will kill a second  innocent man for a murder that occurred in 1992. I have no further words.
