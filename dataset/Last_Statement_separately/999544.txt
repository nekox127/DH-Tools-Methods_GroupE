I just want to say to  the family of Pablo Castro, I appreciate everything that y’all did to try and  communicate with me through the Victim’s Advocacy program.  I tried to  reply back, but there is nothing that I could have said or done that would have  helped you.  I have regret and remorse, this is such a heinous act.   I hope this finds you comfort, if this helps you then I am glad.  I hope  in some shape or form this helps you find closure.  To my wife, my  friends, my son, grasshopper, Dana and homies, I love y’all.  Just know  that I fought a good fight, and I am ready to go.  I am ready Warden.
