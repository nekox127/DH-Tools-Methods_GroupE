I would like to thank my  Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior. I would like to thank all these people in my  life and that aided me in this journey. I would also like to thank the Texas  Department of Criminal Justice inmate Field Minister program True Foster and  Garcia for aiding me in my journey. To Ms. Walkerâ€™s family I pray my death will  bring you peace.
