Yes. I would Warden I call upon peace. To the Victims of the  family. there is not a day that goes by that I do not think about that faithful  event of that day and what transpired. I pray that the lord gives you peace. I  pray that the lord gives you what you seek. There are no words to describe what  you are going through. and I understand your pain. To my family I love you. To  my family out there, and my brothers on death row/ life row I love you. To the  people that have shown compassion and that have been there for me you are my  true family and I have been pleased. I am a man of many faults for those I have  hurt and cause pain in their life. I beg for forgiveness. Let everyone know I  am sorry for all the wrongs that I have done. For those that called for me and  transgressed against me and want me murdered. I forgive you. I truly do. I have  been blessed God these three to four years. Something was brought about by  courageous men of God to make something beautiful. I learned grace. I learned  forgiveness. I learned love, I learned to look at others with love no matter  who they are. I have learned there is no redemption above forgiveness. Like  Abraham Lincoln said once that mercy bears richer fruits than any other  attributes. I pray one day the message of the lord would be heard because the  world is hurting, and things could be better. I don't know what else to say. To  my family, I'm good, I'm strong just know that I'm going to be okay. I'm good.  I love y’all. I love y’all I truly do. I will see y’all in the other world. I'm  ready warden. Send me home.
