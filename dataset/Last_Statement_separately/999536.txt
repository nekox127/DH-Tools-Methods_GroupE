I would like to  apologize to the Nix family for taking Mark away from you. I hope this brings you closure. I want to  say to all my family and friends around the world 'thank you' for supporting me.  To my kids, stand tall and continue to make me proud. Don’t worry about me, I'm ready to fly. Alright Warden, I’m ready to ride.
