I want to take this moment to be shared with everyone, to  give God all the glory of our love, peace wisdom, kindness, and respect. God  knows the truth. He is the truth, the way, and the life. I don’t want this to  be a sad moment for all my friends and loved ones. God gave his blood and died  in 3 days for the glory and grace for all of us that will serve him an  eternity. I want to thank all the field ministers for doing a good job of  changing people and teaching the word of God. It’s a different place now. Thank  you minister and my brothers I, love them. I also want to thank the field  ministers that helped me get through this. I want everyone to have peace in  their heart that only Jesus can give us. I Love you Jennifer, Ashley, and  Fabio. Thank you for everything. Thank you, brother, I’m ready to go home. I’m  ready Warden send me home. I just want everyone to have peace in their heart,  make eternity with Jesus, give him the glory in everything you do. I’m ready.
