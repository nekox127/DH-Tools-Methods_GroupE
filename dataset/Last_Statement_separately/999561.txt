Vetta, Jared, Ray I’m  sorry, no I’m not sorry, I apologize for all the harm I have caused you and  your family. We ate together, we broke bread together, we laughed and cried  together as a family. I’m sorry I failed you, there’s nothing I can do. I’m not  just saying that because I’m laying on this gurney. We were all one and I broke  that bond right or wrong I took not one, but two people that we all loved, and  I had to live with that while I was here. I ask that you forgive me, not for me  but for y’all. I’m fixing to go home and y’all are going to be here. I want to  make sure you don’t suffer. You have to forgive me to heal and move on. Sorry  JT, I always loved you and I told you I will never say goodbye, but this is  goodbye. There’s nothing I can do to bring your mom and sister back. One thing  about the man I used to be, is that I never stopped loving y’all. See y’all on  the other side. God bless you. I’m done Warden.”
