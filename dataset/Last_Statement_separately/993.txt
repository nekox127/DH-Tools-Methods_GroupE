Ok to start with I would like to thank everyone that has stayed;  Karen, Linda, Barry, Danny, Barbara, God bless each and every one of you. I  have a message to the Irby family. The shootout occurred June 27, 1990. One  week later a police officer on his day off named Michael Garret showed up to my  cell. He was wearing civilian clothes. I thought he was a chaplain. He came to the  back where it is super seg. The guys there began to ridicule him because the  officer brought me a small Bible.
He said boy, do you know that you just hit a brick wall? I  am a deputy Sherriff. He asked me have you ever been to church. Have you heard  of Jesus Christ? I said yes, he then gave me a small Bible which I call a  Gideon Bible and read from Romans. The deputy said get right with God. The  Deputy’s buddies, five or six guys standing in the hallway were making fun of him  and the deputy said don’t listen to them, listen to my voice. That was July 4,  1990. I wanted the Irby family to know one thing, I do have remorse for what I did.  Ms. Irby, the little one year old girl, I can’t remember her name, Cody was three  and she was one when I took their father's life away. I pray to God that they  get the closure for me killing their father and Ms. Irby’s husband. I hope to  see you in heaven some day and when you show up I will give you a big hug. To all  of my friends that stuck with me through all of these years I am not going to  say good bye just saying so long. I am ready to go.
