# Echoes of Fate: Analyzing Demographics, Education, and Last Words of Texas' Death Row Inmates

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze data provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) on Death Row inmates. The existing datasets by Samar Hijjazi (Hijjazi, 2020) and Nguyen (Nguyen, 2017) provide valuable information but are outdated and lack some crucial details. To address these limitations, we plan to build upon and enhance the existing datasets.

## Dataset Variables

Our dataset includes the following variables:
 
Last Name  
First Name  
TDCJ Number  
Age  
Date Executed  
Race  
County  
Last Statement Choice (Binary: Yes/No)  
Last statement  
Date of Birth  
Date Received  
Age (When Received)  
Education Level(Highest Grade Completed)   
Date of Offense  
Prior Occupation  

## Objectives

Our primary objectives are to:  

Meticulously analyze textual similarities in the "Last Statements" of inmates.  
Explore common themes or patterns in last statements.  
Identify similarities and differences based on demographic factors such as age, ethnicity, county of origin, and level of education.  
## Research Question (RQ)

What key insights can be drawn from the Texas death row dataset, particularly in terms of race, age, county, education level, prior occupation, and last statements, to enhance our understanding of the death row situation?

## Tools and Technologies

We will use the following tools for analysis:

Voyant: Analyzing frequently occurring words and patterns in the Final Statements.  
R (stylo): Comparing stylistic and linguistic features to understand demographic influences on language use.  
ArcGIS: Providing a clear overview of Texan counties and exploring potential correlations with counties.
