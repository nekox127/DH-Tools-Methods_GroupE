# Echoes of Fate: Analyzing Demographics, Education, and Last Words of Texas' Death Row Inmates

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze data provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) on Death Row inmates.   
The existing datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samerhijjazi/death-row-inmates-last-statements-texas-2020/data) by Samar Hijjazi (Hijjazi, 2020) and Nguyen (Nguyen, 2017) provide valuable information but are outdated and lack some crucial details. To address these limitations, we plan to build upon and enhance the existing datasets.  
We have employed web scraping techniques to update the data, and manually inputted essential information, including 'Level (Highest Grade Completed)', 'Date of Offense', and 'Prior Occupation'.

## Dataset Variables

Our dataset includes the following variables:  
- TDCJ Number
- Age  
- Date Executed
- Race
- County
- Last Statement Choice (Binary: Yes/No)
- Last statement
- Date of Birth
- Date Received
- Age (When Received)
- Education Level(Highest Grade Completed)
- Date of Offense
- Prior Occupation  

## Objectives

Our primary objectives are to:  

- Meticulously analyze textual similarities in the "Last Statements" of inmates.  
- Explore common themes or patterns in last statements.  
- Identify similarities and differences based on demographic factors such as age, race, county of origin, and level of education.  
## Research Question (RQ)

What key insights can be drawn from the Texas death row dataset, particularly in terms of race, age, county, education level, prior occupation, and last statements, to enhance our understanding of the death row situation?

## Tools and Technologies

We will use the following tools for analysis:

- Voyant: Analyzing frequently occurring words and patterns in the last statements.  
- ArcGIS: Providing a clear overview of Texan counties and exploring potential correlations with counties.
- Flourish:  Creating visualizations to elucidate demographic patterns, age, race, educational backgrounds, etc.
## Repository Contents

This Github repository includes:

- A report 
- Dataset files

We will explore the possibility of turning this report into a data visualization story to enhance accessibility and understanding.

## Ethical Consideration
To uphold privacy and ethical standards, we have removed the last name and first name of every inmate in the dataset.
